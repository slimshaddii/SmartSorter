SmartSorter is a lightweight Fabric mod that automatically routes and organizes items using a simple Intake, Output Probes, and a Linking Tool. Keep your chests tidy—no manual sorting.

Highlights

Intake pulls items from an adjacent inventory.
Output Probe points at a target inventory and decides if it accepts items.
Linking Tool connects one Intake to multiple Output Probes.
Smarter routing:
Pulls items in small batches instead of whole stacks.
Prefers merging into existing stacks before using empty slots.
Proper drops and tools:
Mineable with pickaxe or axe; drops itself via loot tables.

Compatibility:
Minecraft: 1.21.1
Mod loader: Fabric
Requires: Fabric API
Java: Minecraft 1.21+ runs on Java 21 (JDK 21 recommended)

How to Use

- Place Output Probes
- Click the face of a chest/barrel you want items to go into.
- The probe faces the block you clicked.
- Place an Intake
- Click the face of the source inventory (the side you want to pull from).
- Link them with the Linking Tool: right‑click the Intake, then each Output Probe.

Crafting
